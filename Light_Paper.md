# Our Own AI (OOAI): Empowering Users with Decentralised AI

## Introduction
Our Own AI (OOAI) is a groundbreaking open-source AI governance framework that aims to revolutionise the way humans and AI agents interact, communicate, and make decisions in the web3 era. OOAI's primary objective is to level the playing field between humans and AI agents, ensuring that their interactions are secure, private, transparent, and equitable. By leveraging decentralised technologies, blockchain-based payment systems, and advanced AI modules, OOAI empowers users with unprecedented control over their data and enables intelligent, context-aware interactions that prioritise user preferences and values.

OOAI recognises the transformative potential of AI but also acknowledges the challenges posed by the current centralised AI landscape, such as data exploitation, lack of transparency, and the concentration of power in the hands of a few entities. To address these issues, OOAI proposes a decentralised, user-centric approach to AI governance that puts the power back in the hands of the users.

Through its innovative architecture, which includes the Data Exchange Core, Multi-Agent System, and Web3 integration, OOAI creates a level playing field where humans and AI agents can interact on equal terms. This framework ensures that AI agents are accountable, transparent, and aligned with user interests while providing users with the tools to manage their data, protect their privacy, and participate in the decision-making processes that shape their digital lives.

## The Need for Decentralised AI
The current digital landscape is plagued by centralisation, data exploitation, and a lack of user control. Centralised entities have amassed vast amounts of user data, leading to privacy concerns, security risks, and the erosion of trust. Moreover, the opaque nature of many AI systems has raised questions about transparency, accountability, and fairness.

OOAI addresses these challenges by putting users at the center of the AI ecosystem. Through decentralised data ownership, secure messaging, and user-centric AI interactions, OOAI aims to restore privacy, trust, and user empowerment in the digital realm.

## Key Features and Components
### Data Exchange Core
At the heart of OOAI lies the Data Exchange Core, a robust and innovative architecture that facilitates secure and efficient data exchange between users, AI agents, and various components of the ecosystem. The Data Exchange Core leverages advanced technologies such as CloudEvents for event management and asynchronous message processing, ensuring seamless communication and data flow across the network.

### Multi-Agent Architecture
OOAI's multi-agent architecture is a key driver of its intelligent and adaptive capabilities. The system employs a diverse set of AI agents, including the Base Agent, Knowledge Agent, and Q Learning Agent, which work collaboratively to provide personalised, context-aware, and engaging user experiences. These agents leverage advanced techniques such as reinforcement learning, knowledge graphs, and natural language processing to continuously learn and adapt to user preferences and behaviors.

### Decentralised Messaging Framework
OOAI's decentralised messaging framework ensures secure and private communication between users and AI agents. The `MessageRouter` struct consumes messages from an MQTT broker, classifies them based on content and metadata, and routes them to corresponding Kafka topics and MQTT topics as CloudEvents. The `MessageEncryption` module further enhances privacy by providing end-to-end encryption for messages using the Ockam framework, leveraging secure channels and key exchange protocols.

### Web3 Integration
OOAI seamlessly integrates with the web3 ecosystem, leveraging decentralised technologies such as blockchain, smart contracts, and decentralised storage. This integration enables secure and transparent data sharing, decentralised identity management, and a token-based economy powered by the SPL token. The `VerifiableCredential` struct and the `Wallet` struct work together to provide decentralised identity and secure data sharing, allowing users to store their credentials in a self-sovereign manner and selectively share them with AI agents and other users.

## Unique Features
OOAI incorporates several unique features that set it apart from other AI and web3 projects:

### Delegate Graph
The `DelegateGraph` is a novel approach to analysing and organising information from natural language inputs. It extracts attributes and connections between entities, allowing AI agents to better understand the context and relationships within the data, enabling more accurate and relevant responses during user interactions.

### Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF)
The `RLHFConfig` struct enables reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) for optimising AI decision-making. By incorporating user feedback into the learning process, OOAI's AI agents can continuously improve their performance and adapt to user preferences over time, resulting in more accurate and satisfying interactions.

### Merkle Tree Implementation
OOAI's Merkle tree implementation, as seen in the `MerkleTree` struct, provides an efficient and secure way to verify the integrity of user data and generate proofs. This is particularly important in the context of decentralised identity and verifiable credentials, where the authenticity and tamper-proofness of data are critical.

## Use Cases and Applications
OOAI's versatile architecture and powerful features enable a wide range of use cases and applications, including:
- Secure, private messaging: The `EncryptedMessageHandler` struct ensures that all communications are protected with state-of-the-art encryption techniques, giving users complete control over their conversational data.
- Decentralised social networks: The `UserGraph` struct forms the backbone of decentralised social networks, enabling the creation of intelligent and context-aware communities.
- Personalised AI assistants: OOAI's intelligent conversational agents, combined with the Multi-Modal Inputs module, enable AI assistants that can understand and communicate through various modalities, providing highly relevant and personalised responses based on the user's context and preferences.
- Decentralised marketplaces: The `ProviderGraph` struct, combined with OOAI's token-based economy and verifiable credentials, enables the creation of secure, transparent, and trustworthy decentralised marketplaces.

## Performance and Scalability
OOAI is designed for high performance and scalability, ensuring efficient messaging, data processing, and AI interactions even as the network grows. The modular architecture, advanced data structures like the `MerkleTree` for efficient verification and proof generation, and the `SpatialEventsGraph` for location-aware AI interactions, showcase OOAI's dedication to scalability and performance optimisation.

The strategic use of Rust and innovative integration of distributed storage solutions throughout the project's codebase ensures that OOAI can handle the growing demands of the web3 ecosystem while maintaining optimal performance and security.

## Roadmap and Future Developments
The OOAI project is committed to continuous innovation and pushing the boundaries of decentralised AI. The roadmap focuses on advancing privacy and security, expanding AI and NLP capabilities, enhancing the Rules Engine, integrating with decentralised infrastructure, fostering community engagement, driving real-world adoption, and embracing emerging technologies.

Some key future developments include:
- Advancing privacy and security through enhanced encryption algorithms, zero-knowledge proofs, and homomorphic encryption.
- Expanding AI and NLP capabilities with advanced techniques for sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and coreference resolution, as well as exploring multimodal learning.
- Enhancing the Rules Engine to enable the creation of granular and context-specific rules that adapt to the unique needs of different applications and domains.
- Integrating with decentralised infrastructure, such as Polkadot, Ethereum, IPFS, and decentralised storage solutions like Filecoin and Arweave.
