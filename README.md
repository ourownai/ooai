## Empowering Privacy with PII Handler
Central to OOAI's mission of returning data ownership to users is the PII Handler, a sophisticated module designed to identify, manage, and protect Personally Identifiable Information (PII). This technology ensures that users can interact with digital services without surrendering their privacy.

**Key Functionalities:**
- Pattern Recognition and Redaction: Utilising advanced regular expressions, the PII Handler can identify a wide range of PII types within text data, from email addresses and phone numbers to more sensitive information like social security and credit card numbers. Once identified, these data points can be redacted, preserving user privacy.
- Customisation for User Control: Beyond predefined patterns, the PII Handler supports extensive customisation. Users can define their own PII patterns and specify how identified information should be redacted, tailoring the balance between privacy and functionality to their individual preferences.

## Intelligent Communication through Classification and Routing
The framework's messaging, classification, and routing system demonstrates OOAI's commitment to not only privacy but also to creating intelligent and efficient communication pathways.

**Key Features:**
- Natural Language Understanding: By leveraging the spaCy library for natural language processing, OOAI can analyse messages, extracting and understanding entities and intents. This allows the framework to categorise messages accurately based on their content and context.
- Dynamic Message Routing: With its advanced classification capabilities, OOAI ensures messages are routed to the appropriate destinations, whether they're Kafka topics or MQTT channels. This process is governed by user preferences and rules, maintaining the user's control over their data and how it's shared.

## Personalised User Experiences with Event Recommendation
At the intersection of privacy and personalisation, the RecommendHandler module stands out. It exemplifies how OOAI uses data responsibly to enhance user experiences through tailored event recommendations.

**How It Works:**
- Graph-Based Event Discovery: Leveraging a Neo4j graph database, the system can identify events aligned with the user's interests and preferences without compromising their privacy. This approach ensures recommendations are both relevant and respectful of the user's data sharing choices.
- Configurable Recommendation Engine: The recommendation process, encompassing event recall, filtering, and sorting, is highly configurable. Users can set their own parameters, defining how events are recommended based on proximity, preferences, and other factors.

## Advanced Learning with Reinforcement on User Graphs
OOAI's approach to continuous improvement and adaptation is encapsulated in the "run_reinforcement_learning" function. This feature harnesses the power of reinforcement learning to optimise the conversational AI's interactions and decision-making processes based on user feedback.
