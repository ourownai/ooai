## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 The Imperative for Decentralised Data Ownership
The rapid advancement of digital technologies has brought about unprecedented connectivity and data-driven interactions. However, this progress has also given rise to a set of challenges that threaten the very foundation of user privacy, data sovereignty, and trust in the digital realm.

In an era where practices like data-laundering are becoming the corporate norm, our digital landscape is increasingly characterised by a stark imbalance of power, with a handful of centralised entities exerting an unprecedented level of control over user data. This concentration of data in the hands of a few corporations has led to the emergence of data monopolies, stifling innovation, and limiting user choice. The lack of competition and accountability has allowed these entities to dictate the terms of data usage, often at the expense of user privacy and autonomy.

Moreover, the centralised architecture of traditional digital platforms has left user data vulnerable to breaches, unauthorised access, and misuse. Users are often left in the dark about how their data is collected, stored, and shared, leading to an erosion of privacy and control. The opaque data practices of centralised entities have eroded user trust and raised concerns about the security of personal information in the digital age.

The unchecked monetisation of user data has not only undermined individual privacy but has also contributed to the spread of misinformation, political polarisation, and the erosion of democratic processes. The lack of transparency and accountability in digital transactions has created a trust deficit that hinders the growth and adoption of digital services. Users are often required to blindly trust centralised intermediaries with their sensitive information and financial assets, leaving them vulnerable to fraud, hacking, and censorship.

The concentration of data and computing power in a few central nodes makes the entire system vulnerable to attacks, outages, and censorship. The reliance on centralised infrastructure has also limited the scalability and interoperability of decentralised digital services, hindered innovation and curtailed the global adoption of Web3 solutions.

The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies has brought about a new set of challenges related to transparency, accountability, and fairness. The opaque nature of many AI systems has raised concerns about bias, discrimination, and the potential for misuse. The lack of traceability means AI decision-making processes are nearly impossible to audit. This has eroded user trust and limited the ability to hold AI systems accountable for their actions.

Instead of attempting to reengineer the blackbox solutions that AI models and their layer 1 APIs have become, we propose a governance layer owned by the end-user that operates on the principle of zero-trust with any external AI or data provider. This approach represents a critical paradigm shift in the way we approach data ownership, privacy, and AI interactions.

It is against this backdrop that the OOAI project emerges as a pioneering solution, leveraging decentralised technologies and user-centric design principles to empower individuals and restore trust in the digital ecosystem.

### 1.2 Embracing User Empowerment through AI
OOAI recognises the transformative potential of AI in enhancing user experiences and driving positive outcomes. However, it also acknowledges the limitations of current AI systems in providing truly personalised, context-aware, and empathetic interactions.

To address these limitations, OOAI embraces a user-centric approach to AI development, placing the needs, preferences, and values of individuals at the forefront. By leveraging advanced natural language processing techniques, knowledge graphs, and reinforcement learning algorithms, OOAI aims to create AI agents that can understand and respond to user queries in a highly contextual and engaging manner.

OOAI's AI agents are designed to learn from user interactions and adapt their behaviour based on individual preferences and feedback. This approach enables the creation of personalised AI experiences that cater to the unique needs and contexts of each user, fostering a deeper sense of engagement and trust.

Moreover, OOAI's commitment to transparency and explainability in AI decision-making processes empowers users to understand how their data is being used and how AI agents arrive at their recommendations. By providing users with greater control over their AI interactions and the ability to influence the learning process, OOAI aims to create a more collaborative and empowering relationship between users and AI systems.

### 1.3 Bridging the Gap with Repurposed Technology
The OOAI project draws inspiration from the pioneering work of the BigBot foundational project, an ambitious Django-based system that was under development with varying intensity over the course of 8 years. The BigBot project was initially built as a Django framework and associated front-end applications designed to simplify chatbot adoption for small and medium enterprises. It was a solution aimed at making rules-based automation faster and cheaper. Early on it started to employ NLTK and libraries like spaCy and RASA to simplify integrations with various enterprise ORMs. It was a full-fledged messaging back-end with support for virtually unlimited bots. 

The advent of usable generative AI quickly changed the landscape and the BigBot project was forced to pivot, finding a new home in the history's largest gigaproject. After a year of clearly diverging philosophy and failure to reach a licensing deal, the Big Bot team has taken the decision to pivot and open source the bulk of its legacy code under a copyleft licence. OOAI builds on top of many BigBot principles and philosophies but has a completely new engine under the hood.

The pivot away from pursuing closed-source licensing deals represents the founder's increasing concern about the data and AI landscape rapidly eroding individual rights and control. By embracing the principles of decentralisation, transparency, and community-driven development, OOAI aims to create a more resilient and trustworthy platform for AI and data exchange. Whether the project thrives or dies depends very much on how fast it garners support and a global community. The source code will be licensed under a permissive license for individual users with commercial restrictions. The software will interface with providers through a list of widely adopted protocols and standards which corporate entities are already aligned to. The software is expressly designed to serve the needs of the indidivual, to put powerful assistants and data brokers in their hands.

By making the project's codebase and documentation publicly available, OOAI invites researchers, developers, and enthusiasts from around the world to contribute to its development and help shape the future of decentralised AI.

The project has minted a fixed supply of SPL token with 10% reserved for the founding team and the rest vesting according to a transparent schedule. There will be one DAO with locked tokens gradually disbursed to two distinct wallets that will be administered for only 2 purposes - engineering and development (to fund code contributions and infrastructure costs), and marketing.

The open-source approach serves as a safeguard against the potential abuse of AI technologies and the concentration of power in the hands of a few entities. By decentralising the development and governance of AI systems, OOAI aims to create a more equitable and accountable ecosystem, where the benefits of AI are distributed fairly and the risks are mitigated through collective oversight.

This important paradigm means that users will eventually have the data and compute requirements that make them a direct end consumer of processing power and hardware. As the project grows, a distributed marketplace will emerge where users can buy and sell services from each other in a peer-to-peer manner. This marketplace will be permissionless and open to all, governed by cryptoeconomic protocols that align incentives towards cooperation and transparency.

The OOAI project represents a bold vision for the future of AI and data ownership, one that prioritises user empowerment, privacy, and trust. By repurposing successful technologies and lessons learned, OOAI is well-positioned to bridge the gap between the promise and the reality of AI in the web3 era.

In the following sections, we delve deeper into the technical architecture and key components of OOAI, showcasing how this innovative platform addresses the challenges of data sovereignty, trust, and intelligent interactions in the decentralised web.

## 2. Problem Statement

### 2.1 Data Centralisation: A Monopolistic Concern
The current digital landscape is characterised by a stark imbalance of power, with a handful of centralised entities exerting an unprecedented level of control over user data. This concentration of data in the hands of a few corporations has led to the emergence of data monopolies, stifling innovation and limiting user choice. The lack of competition and accountability has allowed these entities to dictate the terms of data usage, often at the expense of user privacy and autonomy.

### 2.2 User Data under Siege: Privacy and Control at Risk
The centralised architecture of traditional digital platforms has left user data vulnerable to breaches, unauthorised access, and misuse. Users are often left in the dark about how their data is collected, stored, and shared, leading to a erosion of privacy and control. The opaque data practices of centralised entities have eroded user trust and raised concerns about the security of personal information in the digital age.

### 2.3 The Data Exploitation Economy: Risks and Ramifications
The current digital ecosystem has given rise to a data exploitation economy, where user data is treated as a commodity to be bought, sold, and leveraged for profit. This has led to the proliferation of invasive tracking, targeted advertising, and the manipulation of user behavior. The unchecked monetisation of user data has not only undermined individual privacy but has also contributed to the spread of misinformation, political polarisation, and the erosion of democratic processes.

### 2.4 The Trust Deficit in Digital Transactions
The lack of transparency and accountability in digital transactions has created a trust deficit that hinders the growth and adoption of digital services. Users are often required to blindly trust centralised intermediaries with their sensitive information and financial assets, leaving them vulnerable to fraud, hacking, and censorship. The absence of secure and decentralised mechanisms for establishing trust has limited the potential of digital interactions and hindered the development of a truly inclusive and empowering digital economy.

### 2.5 The Perils of Centralisation: Single Points of Failure
The centralised architecture of traditional digital systems has created single points of failure that pose significant risks to the stability and resilience of the digital ecosystem. The concentration of data and computing power in a few central nodes makes the entire system vulnerable to attacks, outages, and censorship. The reliance on centralised infrastructure has also limited the scalability and interoperability of digital services, hindering innovation and limiting the potential for global adoption.

### 2.6 The Quest for Transparency and Accountability in AI
The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies has brought about a new set of challenges related to transparency, accountability, and fairness. The opaque nature of many AI systems has raised concerns about bias, discrimination, and the potential for misuse. The lack of explainability and auditability in AI decision-making processes has eroded user trust and limited the ability to hold AI systems accountable for their actions.

### 2.7 The AI Disengagement Dilemma
The current state of AI interactions often leaves users feeling disengaged and disconnected from the technology. The lack of personalisation, context-awareness, and emotional intelligence in AI systems has limited their ability to provide meaningful and empathetic interactions. This disengagement has hindered the adoption of AI technologies and limited their potential to enhance user experiences and drive positive outcomes.

### 2.8 The Fallacy of One-Size-Fits-All in AI Interactions
The diversity of human needs, preferences, and contexts requires AI systems that can adapt and tailor their interactions accordingly. However, the current approach to AI development often relies on a one-size-fits-all model that fails to account for individual differences and cultural nuances. This lack of personalisation has limited the effectiveness of AI systems and hindered their ability to provide truly user-centric experiences.

### 2.9 The Critical Need for Intelligent, Contextual Engagement
The success of AI systems in the digital age depends on their ability to engage users in intelligent, contextual, and empathetic interactions. The current state of AI technology falls short in this regard, often providing generic, scripted responses that fail to capture the nuances of human communication. The lack of contextual understanding and emotional intelligence in AI systems has limited their ability to build trust, foster engagement, and drive meaningful outcomes.

The OOAI project aims to address these fundamental challenges by leveraging the power of decentralised technologies, BigBot architectures, and a token-based economy. By providing a secure, transparent, and user-centric platform for data ownership, AI interactions, and digital transactions, OOAI seeks to empower users, restore trust, and unlock the full potential of the web3 era.
