Recommendations Crate
The Recommendations crate provides functionality for recommending events to users based on their preferences, location, and timing. It consists of three main modules:

event_recommendations.rs: Defines the RecommendHandler struct and the recommendation process.
rlhf.rs: Implements a reinforcement learning process using the Q-learning algorithm to optimize decision-making within a user graph.
visualiser.rs: (Not provided in the given code snippets)
Event Recommendations (event_recommendations.rs)
The event_recommendations module defines the RecommendHandler struct, which is responsible for recommending events to users. The recommendation process involves several stages:

Recall Stage: Retrieves a list of potential event candidates based on user preferences and proximity using a Neo4j graph database.
Dependency Loading Stage: Loads additional dependencies for each event candidate, such as checking event schedulability and other logistical considerations.
Filtering Stage: Filters out event candidates based on certain criteria, such as distance thresholds and schedulability.
Sorting Stage: Sorts the remaining event candidates based on user preferences, event significance, and other relevant metrics.
The RecommendHandler utilizes asynchronous operations for database interactions and the processing pipeline. It integrates with a larger system that manages user interactions, event data, and user preferences.

Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (rlhf.rs)
The rlhf module introduces the run_reinforcement_learning function, which executes a reinforcement learning process on a UserGraph structure using a Q-learning algorithm. The function optimizes the decision-making policy within the graph.

Key functionalities of the reinforcement learning process include:

Initialization of a Q-learning agent with the user graph's dimensions and learning parameters.
Execution of a learning loop where the agent observes the current state, selects an action, simulates the action, processes feedback, and updates the Q-value.
Adaptation of the exploration rate over time to balance exploration and exploitation.
Implementation of an early stopping mechanism based on the stabilization of the learning process.
Logging of learning progress metrics for monitoring and analysis purposes.
The learning loop continues until a terminal condition is met, such as convergence, reaching a maximum number of iterations, or encountering an operational error.

Visualiser (visualiser.rs)
The visualiser module is not provided in the given code snippets. It is expected to contain functionality related to visualizing the recommendations or the user graph.

Usage
To use the Recommendations crate in your Rust project, add the following to your Cargo.toml file:

[dependencies]
recommendations = { path = "path/to/recommendations" }



Then, you can import and use the modules in your Rust code:

use recommendations::event_recommendations::RecommendHandler;
use recommendations::rlhf::run_reinforcement_learning;



Make sure to configure the necessary dependencies, such as the Neo4j database connection, and provide the required data structures and configurations for the recommendation process.
