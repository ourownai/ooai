Streams
The streams module in the DataExchange architecture provides functionality for consuming and producing messages using various messaging systems, such as Kafka and MQTT. It includes support for converting messages to CloudEvents format, combining streams with futures, and consuming and producing messages using Kafka and MQTT.

CloudEvents
The cloudevents module (src/streams/cloudevents.rs) provides functionality for handling CloudEvents. It defines the CloudEventHandler struct, which is responsible for subscribing to MQTT topics, handling incoming events, and routing messages based on their classification.

The CloudEventHandler struct contains a KafkaProducer for sending messages to Kafka topics and an AsyncClient for interacting with the MQTT broker. It provides methods for subscribing to MQTT topics, handling incoming events, and creating CloudEvents.

The handle_events method continuously listens for incoming MQTT messages, deserializes them into CloudEvents, extracts the classification extension, and routes the message based on the classification using the route_message method.

The create_cloudevent function is a utility function for creating a CloudEvent with a given classification and message payload.

Combine
The combine module (src/streams/combine.rs) defines the Combine struct, which allows combining a stream and a future. It enables the processing of stream items until the future completes.

The Combine struct takes a stream and a future as generic type parameters. It implements the Stream trait, which allows it to be used as a stream itself. The poll_next method of the Stream trait is implemented to poll the stream and the future simultaneously. If the future completes, the Combine stream will also complete. If the stream produces an item, it will be yielded.

Kafka
The kafka module (src/streams/kafka.rs) provides functionality for consuming and producing messages using Kafka. It defines the KafkaSink struct for producing messages to Kafka topics and the KafkaStream struct for consuming messages from Kafka topics.

The KafkaSink struct implements the Sink trait, allowing it to consume items and send them to a Kafka topic. It serializes the input item and sends it as a message to the specified Kafka topic using the FutureProducer from the rdkafka library.

The KafkaStream struct represents a stream of messages from a Kafka topic. It takes a MessageStream from the rdkafka library and an UnboundedSender for sending replies. It implements the Stream trait, yielding Result<Envelop<Event, BorrowedMessage<'a>>, KafkaConsumerError> where each item represents either a successfully enveloped CloudEvent or an error indicating a failure in message consumption or conversion.

The DataExchangeKafkaConsumer struct provides functionality to consume messages from a Kafka topic using StreamConsumer and process them asynchronously. It facilitates message commitment and error handling through a spawned Tokio task, which listens for replies indicating the success or failure of message processing.

Mock
The mock module (src/streams/mock.rs) provides a mock implementation of a stream for testing purposes. It defines the MockSource struct, which is a simple stream that yields a unit item at a specified interval.

The MockSource struct takes a Duration as input and implements the Stream trait. It maintains an internal Sleep future to control the interval between each item. The poll_next method of the Stream trait is implemented to yield a unit item every time the specified duration elapses.

MQTT
The mqtt module (src/streams/mqtt.rs) provides functionality for consuming and producing messages using MQTT. It defines the MQTTStream struct, which represents a stream of messages from an MQTT topic.

The MQTTStream struct takes an EventLoop and an UnboundedSender for sending replies. It implements the Stream trait, yielding Result<Envelop<Event, Publish>, Error> where each item represents either a successfully enveloped CloudEvent or an error indicating a failure in message consumption or conversion.

The DataExchangeMQTTStream struct provides functionality to consume messages from an MQTT topic using AsyncClient and `EventLoop' from therumqttc library and process them asynchronously. It facilitates message handling and error handling through a spawned Tokio task, which listens for replies indicating the success or failure of message processing.

Roadmap and TODO
Before the streams crate can be compiled and published, there are several tasks and improvements that need to be addressed:

Error Handling: Improve error handling throughout the crate. Ensure that all potential errors are properly handled and propagated. Define custom error types where necessary to provide more meaningful error messages.

Testing: Implement comprehensive unit tests for all the modules and structs in the streams crate. Write test cases to cover various scenarios, including success cases, error cases, and edge cases. Ensure that the tests are reliable and provide good coverage.

Documentation: Enhance the documentation of the crate by adding detailed comments and documentation for each module, struct, and function. Provide clear explanations of the purpose, usage, and behavior of each component. Include examples and code snippets to illustrate how to use the crate effectively.

Configuration: Add support for configurable settings, such as Kafka and MQTT connection details, topic names, and other relevant parameters. Allow users to provide configuration through a configuration file or environment variables.

Logging: Integrate logging functionality into the crate to provide informative and structured logs. Use a logging framework like log or tracing to log important events, errors, and debug information. Ensure that the logging level can be controlled through configuration.

Metrics: Implement metrics collection and reporting to monitor the performance and health of the streams crate. Use a metrics library like prometheus or metrics to collect relevant metrics, such as message throughput, processing latency, and error rates. Expose the metrics endpoint for monitoring and alerting purposes.

Resilience: Enhance the resilience of the crate by implementing retry mechanisms and error recovery strategies. Handle temporary failures, such as network issues or broker unavailability, gracefully. Implement exponential backoff and retry logic to handle transient errors.

Performance Optimization: Profile and optimize the performance of the streams crate. Identify and address any performance bottlenecks or inefficiencies. Consider using asynchronous programming techniques and leveraging Rust's concurrency features to improve throughput and scalability.

Integration Tests: Write integration tests to verify the end-to-end functionality of the streams crate. Set up a test environment with Kafka and MQTT brokers and ensure that the crate can successfully consume and produce messages in real-world scenarios.

Examples and Tutorials: Provide comprehensive examples and tutorials demonstrating how to use the streams crate in different scenarios. Include examples for consuming and producing messages using Kafka and MQTT, handling CloudEvents, and combining streams with futures.

Continuous Integration: Set up a continuous integration (CI) pipeline to automatically build, test, and validate the crate on each code change. Use a CI service like Travis CI or GitHub Actions to ensure that the crate remains in a stable and releasable state.

Packaging and Distribution: Prepare the crate for packaging and distribution. Ensure that the crate metadata, such as the Cargo.toml file, is properly configured. Publish the crate to the Rust package registry (crates.io) to make it easily accessible to other Rust developers.
